# Mario Kart Wii file replacer

Takes path to an extracted game image and a folder with texture hacks, music hacks etc and automatically finds and replaces files

**TO-DO**:
- Integrate with Wiimms ISO Tools to enable directly patching an iso using CLI args, no need to extract game from ISO.
- Add option to extract game image from within program
- Put functions and funciton declarations in seperate header file
- Maybe re-write in C++ so that I can add a cross platform gui
